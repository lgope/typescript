# Typescript

- `TypeScript` is a strict superset of `ECMAScript 2015`, which is itself a superset of ECMAScript 5, commonly referred to as JavaScript. As such, a JavaScript program is also a valid TypeScript program, and a TypeScript program can seamlessly consume `JavaScript`.

- A superset of JavaScript, TypeScript offers all of the features of JavaScript plus some additional perks. TypeScript intrinsically encourages us to code cleanly, making the code more scalable.

## Primary goals of Typescript

1. Provide Javascript developers with an **optional type system**
2. Provide Javascript developers with the ability to utilize planned features from **future Javascript editions** against current Javascript engines
